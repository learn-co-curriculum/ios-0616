## 2015 - WWDC


* [Protocol-Oriented Programming in Swift](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2015/408/) - At the heart of Swift's design are two incredibly powerful ideas: protocol-oriented programming and first class value semantics. Each of these concepts benefit predictability, performance, and productivity, but together they can change the way we think about programming. Find out how you can apply these ideas to improve the code you write.

* [Building Better Apps With Value Types in Swift](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc/2015/?id=414) - Swift supports rich first-class value types in the form of powerful structs, which provide new ways to architect your apps. Learn about the differences between reference and value types, how value types help you elegantly solve common problems around mutability and thread safety, and discover how Swift's unique capabilities might change the way you think about abstraction.

* [Whats New In Swift](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2015/106/) - Swift continues its rapid advancement with version 2. New optimizations make your app run even faster, and new syntax makes your code more expressive. Learn about powerful new features like error handling, testability, and availability checking. This session will help you write even better apps by moving to Swift 2.
