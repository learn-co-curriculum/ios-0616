# BlogTalks
## Why are blogs important?
One of the most certain and powerful ways to cement your understanding of a subject is to teach it to others. Teaching is also an excellent way to develop communication and presentation skills. These skills in particular are important because as a developer you will inevitably have to explain technical concepts to people who may or may not be well technically versed, whether in a job interview or talking to non-developers who are your superiors or on your team.

Writing and presenting blog posts is a fantastic way to practice the art of teaching. You'll know very well the topics you cover and have access to the blogs your classmates write when you eventually come across those subjects in your own work. Furthermore, your contribution will add value to the developer community as a whole. If there's something you've struggled to understand, undoubtedly there are others whove shared your same frustration. By writing a blog post to explain that which you've figured out, you're providing an easier path for those who come after you.

Lastly, writing blog posts on a regular basis shows potential employers you're interested and engaged in the field of software development. Blog posts on interesting topics help you stand apart from your competition in the job market, and often provide a great point of discussion when networking or interviewing.

## Instructions
In order to teach something well, you must be able to internalize and simplify it so that it's approachable and relatable. Find a topic related to iOS development and dig into it. The best blog posts are often those that don't directly overlap with the content you learn through lectures and labs. If you struggle to understand a concept, consider it a prime topic to learn and write about, then share with your class. Be sure to use examples in your blog post to show why the topic you're covering is relevant and/or interesting.

Groups will be assigned and every day on a rotating basis one group will present their blog posts. Each person's presentation should take no longer than eight minutes with two minutes at the end for questions. Do not read your blog post, but instead summarize the key points and learnings.

## Details

* Any major blogging platform is acceptable, but we reccomend [Medium](https://medium.com) for its clear layout and ability to cleanly display code snippets.
* It's very important that your online presence be professional and separate from any private accounts you may have. An employer wants to see what technologies you've been exploring, not Instagram photos of your lunch or rants about the construction outside your window this morning.
* Follow and support your classmates by sharing and liking their posts, and feel free to ask them to do the same for you!
